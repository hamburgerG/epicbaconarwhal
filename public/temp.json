In fact, I couldn't tell you what the first song was that diverged from the normal mix, but after a couple tunes, I started to notice a theme - all of the songs were storm-oriented.

When examining the abortion argument, people who are pro-life believe it is the ethically correct choice based upon 3 assumptions. \n\n1. Taking an innocent life is wrong.\n2. A fetus counts as an innocent life.*\n3. Hence, taking a fetus life is wrong\n(Number 2 is the point that is debated)\n\nOn the other hand, the pro-choice argument usually goes as follows:\n\n1.Women have a right to control what happens in their bodies.\n2. abortion is part of this right\n3. It should not be illegal to exercise control over one's body.\n(The topic debated here is number 2, both sides agree on 1 and 3)\n\nIn other words, pro-life people are against it because they think its a form of murder. They conclude that if murder is wrong, abortion must be too. \n\nWhile they will agree that a woman has the right to exercise control over her body, obviously there are limitations, for example, lets suppose a woman, out of her own free will, decided to move into an apartment next to a smoker. The smoker continues to smoke, and the woman realizes that the second hand smoke is having a negative effect on her body. Obviously both sides would agree that it would not be ethical for her to go kill the smoker. Both sides would probably agree on this. I do not use this example as a metaphor for abortion, but rather to show that in some cases, other factors might override her right to control what happens to her body. In this case it would be appropriate to move, not kill the person.\n\nNote: While the previous example could potentially be argued for as being a metaphor for abortion, I have no intention of arguing for or against abortion)\n\nWhat I am saying is that, as someone who is \"pro-life\" (omg downvote me to hell because I have a different view than you!) I make my choice because I believe it is the correct ethical choice. While in some cases abortion may be appropriate, such as when the mothers life is in danger, rape, or incest, I believe life should be celebrated, and that everyone deserves the ability to pursue their happiness.\n\nWith that being said, I could care less if the person was gay or not. The argument for pro-lifers is not \n\n1. \"I like the fetus, so don't kill it\"\n2. \"Oh wait, the fetus is gay?\"\n3. \"Oh nevermind. Kill the fetus!\"\n\nPro-lifers do not think it is ethical to kill a homosexual simply on the grounds of being homosexual. (Extremes aside) Similarly, they would not support an abortion if they knew the child was homosexual, following:\n\n1. We assume the person who is pro-life thinks abortion is similar to murder.\n2. Murder is wrong, regardless of sexual orientation.\n3. Abortion, regardless of sexual orientation.\n\nIf you actually want to convince a pro-life person that abortion should be acceptable, you should be trying to convince them that killing a fetus within X time period should be allowed because at that point the fetus should not be considered a life.\n\nIn my opinion, post like this seem rather arrogant, and look to be nothing more than a giant circle-jerk, making general assumptions, many of them incorrect, (such as that we would kill a fetus just because it is homosexual) making a stereotype so general that it is easy to poke at. \n\nIf your intention is to have a circle jerk for your own enjoyment, that is fine. To each their own. However, it is not really adding anything to the conversation.\n\nI am pro-life, I am also a Mormon. (Oh shoot religion! Hurry downvote because I am different! If I am religious I must not be a free thinker right!)\n\nWith that my position being made known, let me tell you what I would do my wife was pregnant with a boy (or girl), and we found out that the child was going to be/is gay.\n1. Have the child. (The child's sexuality has no impact on the morality of the situation.)\n2. Love him. Respect him.\n\nIt's that simple. it's called humanity.","created_utc":1362444867.0,"downs":8,"ups":36},{"name":"t1_c8ppc7w","author":"S3cretSpartan","body":"Probably not.

The disagreement between people on issues of abortion and gay marriage is not usually on who's rights we should and should not protect, but rather on who actually has the rights they are being said to have. What I mean is, I don't think many pro-choice people argue \"fetuses have a right to life but we shouldn't protect it\" and I don't think many opponents of gay marriage argue \"gay people have the right to marry but we should not grant them it\". So if you are pro-life, it does not make it hypocritical to not defend someones right to gay-marriage or any other sort of equality, because perhaps the pro-lifer does not believe those rights exist in the first place. It only becomes hypocritical if the right to life is not recognized. I mean, one could very well approach a liberal atheist, who's pro-gay rights and anti-guns (for example) and say, \"you defend the rights of gay people, but if those gay people own guns will you then defend their rights?\" It's a meaningless argument until you establish which rights do and do not exist.","created_utc":1362439974.0,"downs":2,"ups":11},{"name":"t1_c8ptei8","author":"infinitefragment","body":"only if it wants to party","created_utc":1362443786.0,"downs":0,"ups":3},{"name":"t1_c8ptp7k","author":null,"body":null,"created_utc":null,"downs":null,"ups":null}]}]},{"name":"technology","posts":[{"name":"t3_19nb00","author":"SayNoToCAS1","created_utc":1362417574.0,"domain":"falkvinge.net","is_self":false,"permalink":"/r/technology/comments/19nb00/after_being_cut_from_norway_the_pirate_bay/","selftext":"","thumbnail":"","title":"After Being Cut From Norway, The Pirate Bay Returns From North Korea","url":"http://falkvinge.net/2013/03/04/after-being-cut-from-norway-the-pirate-bay-returns-from-north-korea/","downs":9567,"num_comments":2067,"score":2742,"ups":12309,"comments":[{"name":"t1_c8pl0kb","author":"nahden","body":"Press release, posted 6 mins ago\n\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/blog/229\n\n&gt;FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE, 3 MARCH 102, \ud3c9\uc591 (PYONGYANG).\n\n&gt;The Pirate Bay has been hunted in many countries around the world. Not for illegal activities but being persecuted for beliefs of freedom of information. Today, a new chapter is written in the history of the movement, as well as the history of the internets.\n\n&gt;A week ago we could reveal that The Pirate Bay was accessed via Norway and Catalonya. The move was to ensure that these countries and regions will get attention to the issues at hand. Today we can reveal that we have been invited by the leader of the republic of Korea, to fight our battles from their network.\n\n&gt;This is truly an ironic situation. We have been fighting for a free world, and our opponents are mostly huge corporations from the United States of America, a place where freedom and freedom of speech is said to be held high. At the same time, companies from that country is chasing a competitor from other countries, bribing police and lawmakers, threatening political parties and physically hunting people from our crew. And to our help comes a government famous in our part of the world for locking people up for their thoughts and forbidding access to information.\n\n&gt;We believe that being offered our virtual asylum in Korea is a first step of this country's changing view of access to information. It's a country opening up and one thing is sure, they do not care about threats like others do. In that way, TPB and Korea might have a special bond. We will do our best to influence the Korean leaders to also let their own population use our service, and to make sure that we can help improve the situation in any way we can. When someone is reaching out to make things better, it's also ones duty to grab their hand.\n\n&gt;by Kim Jung-Bay\n\nthe host &gt; 175.45.177.217 &gt; http://bgp.he.net/AS131279\n\nEDIT: ***a comment over at HN claims they're not hosted in NK***\n\n&gt;fale@machine:~$ tcptraceroute -f 128 -m 128 thepiratebay.se Selected device venet0, address 5.9.249.8, port 40771 for outgoing packets Tracing the path to thepiratebay.se (194.71.107.15) on TCP port 80 (www), 128 hops max 128 thepiratebay.org (194.71.107.15) [open] 51.673 ms 49.002 ms 47.187 ms\n\n&gt;*That server is in Germany, no way it's possible to have 50ms to NK.
